Re-skinning Northeastern University Libraries’ Primo UI With the launch of Alma on July 1, 2013, Northeastern University Libraries introduced the new Scholar OneSearch, a Primo installation featuring responsive and user-friendly design.

<!-- excerpt -->

We’re especially proud of our responsive design, which allows flexibility and functionality beyond the default mobile stylesheet. We’re also happy to have WorldCat NRE requests integrated successfully. Scholar OneSearch also improves upon some of the features in the standard Primo release, including a reorganized page header, collapsible facets in the left-hand “refine my results” sidebar, and integrated feedback into each search result.
