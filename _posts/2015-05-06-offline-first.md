Working on the mobile web platform for [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), performance can become the technical bottlekneck that limits the ultimate goal of our success, customer aquisition to the platform. The initial experience with the web page is everything, and if our initial experience takes more than a couple of seconds or doesn't work at all, we have probably lost that person as a customer forever. 

As I commute to and from the office in Mountain View from San Francisco, the center of inovation, I continually experience frustrating or totally broken experiences trying to use the web. Sitting in the caltrain, the LTE signal frequently acts more like pre-edge data services and some sites will refuse to load. My experience is not unique. Around the world, more business is done through a mobile device with limited bandwidth and sometimes no connection at all.

> "Frequently not having any data connection in even the wealthiest and most developed cities of the world has led us to conclude that no, the mobile connectivity/bandwidth issue isnâ€™t just going to solve itself on a global level anywhere in the near future."
