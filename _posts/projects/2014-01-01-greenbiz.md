This project was the largest project taken on by Kalamuna at the time. I was brought onto the project about halfway through the build and was tasked with some complicated tasks of helping harmonize and componentize the sites many features needed. This site acted as a blog, media, event and much more for the organization who's primary task was to help work with businesses to see the business value in improving their sustainability efforts.
