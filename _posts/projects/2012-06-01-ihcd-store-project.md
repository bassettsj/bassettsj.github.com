Researched and developed a plan to move the eCommerce store for the [Institute of Human Centered Design](http://ihcdesign.org). The project had the unique challenges in that the site itself had to be accessible for all users. That contraint lead us in search for an e-commerce platform that was more accessible out of the box. After evaluating a few options we selected the Drupal ubercart distribution to build our application. Working with a small design team of Lise Capet and myself we aimed at building a new site that would be organzied around the principle of collections based on simple iconography.
