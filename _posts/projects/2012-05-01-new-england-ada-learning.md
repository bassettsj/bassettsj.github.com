The New England ADA Center has worked on creating a new site to fit their mission to provide education and information as a knowledge transmission ceter for the New England Region.

The project invloved the help of Yale Cohen as an instructional designer and project lead. The content was manualy migrate the content to the new system. Restructure the content in to learning modules. Developed a simple theme for the system.

Media and media player accessibility was one of the greatest challenges. Using MediaElements.js was my personal preference, but the decision was made to use JWplayer.
