The American's with Disabilities Act, the ADA, was updated to include new guidelines for helping to create a more inclusive and non-descrimitaory nation. With this updated guidelines and regulations, many people / organizations have had questions about how these changes will effect them and their compliance with the law. The [New England ADA Center](http://newenglandada.org) has distilled the changes to a simple to use checklist. The checklist is used to evaluate buildings and facilities to see if they fit the ADA policies.

My role was to help build the website for the ADA checklist.
