The Minuteman Classic is an annual LGBT softball tournament held in Boston, Massachusetts by the local Beantown Softball League. In 2012 a small budget was made available to contract work out for a redesigned website to better accommodate for their needs. The website was going to used for live score updates, event information and register for the event.

The old design was very basic and didn't provide good access on smaller screen sizes.
