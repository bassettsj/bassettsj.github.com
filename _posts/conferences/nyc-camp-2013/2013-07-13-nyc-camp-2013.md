### What is Vagrant?

* A wrapper on VBoxManage
* A workflow
* A way of life ?

### Why use a virtualization for development?

Snapshotting is awesome, rebuilding and imitating the prod environment.

Puppet / Chef will make provisioning easiers. Vagrant is a wrapper for vbox manage, which is poorly written. This creates a vm and provide the base instance.

### Installing Vagrant

Run these GUI installers

Download virtualbox, then the vagrant installer, (no longer a gem)


### Vagrant Docs

[Beautiful just like this beautifully simple tool.](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

### Base Boxes
* Just a VM images with vagrant user & ssh keys
* Virtualbox guest additions
* Installed chef, ruby & puppet

Vewee can help build a basebox.


## Don't be STUPID, Grasp SOLID
[Blog: Don't be STUPID, Grasp SOLID!](http://nikic.github.io/2011/12/27/Dont-be-STUPID-GRASP-SOLID.html)

### What is object oriented programming?
You don't necessairly need classes and objects. We can create OOP projects using  an API, analogy of 

### STUPID

#### **S**ingleton
Single purpose code.

#### **T**ight Coupling
You would have to rebuild the app since the code is specific and not modular.

#### **U**ntestable Code
House of cards code, changing the code in one place can cause global issues.

#### **P**remature Optimization

#### **I**ndescriptive Naming
If the other developers that use your code need to think, you need to rethink your naming.

#### **D**uplication
The Rule of Three, if I need to copy and past it twice, then you should refactor.

### SOLID

#### **S**ingle Responsibility
Do one thing and do it well. Keep your objects, methods narrow

#### **O**pen/Close Principle 
Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### **L**iskov substitution principle
Parent type is left then we extend the parent type. The children add but never limit.

#### **I**nterface Segregation Principle

#### **D**ependency inversion principle

### Law of Demeter
Principle of Least Knwoldege. Your code should never assume to know more than the first degree.

### Principle of Least Astonishment
Your code should not surprise, it should be obvious and self document. It should be as intuititve as possible.
