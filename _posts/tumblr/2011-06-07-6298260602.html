<p><strong>23 GBs of Photos, documents and movies, scanned images and records of the last 4-years of work in school. I am posting some examples of my student work that might be relevant for a professional profile online.</strong></p>

<p>Creating a web-presence is a important step for recent grads looking for careers. This means making sure what is public is safe and professional. This could mean looking though your FaceBook Privacy Settings a bit. Also this may be trying new networks that you may not have used before now.</p>

<p>Creating a web-presence is a great tool when networking and looking for a job, but also <em>easier</em> than ever before.</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Colorado, Boulder and moving to the Bay Area, I am using Social Networking to help find connections and a job.</p>

<p>As a young grad with a background in IT Support and Admin,  looking for work in the Bay Area. I have been using Twitter, LinkedIn and Tumblr to put myself out there and to also hear from companies I am interested in working for.</p>

<p>Twitter may be one of the best tools for recent grads and people looking for a job. It allows you to broadcast yourself to companies and what you are doing in the world, but more importantly, many companies are using twitter to announce openings. I have been slowly following companies I am interested in to get news on new position opening and what is happening in the industry.</p>

<p><img height="50" width="50" alt="tumblr." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljv0b20OhP1qf95sb.png" align="left"/> Tumblr might be a great way for a recent graduate to give themselves a web presence. It is easy to create and maintain a professional/personal blog. I am hoping to use tumblr to post information on exciting projects I might get to work on in the future and a spot to showcase past achievements. Creating a place to maintain my writing skills is very important to me.</p>

<p><img align="left" height="50" width="50" alt="LinkedIn" src="http://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/elegantmediaicons/PNG/linkedin.png"/><br/>LinkedIn is quickly becoming the largest professional social networking site. I am sure everyone has heard about it. For me it has been really helpful to use the connections I have built up to find on finding a personal contact when I apply for a position.</p>

<p>Reply back if you have any other tips. I would love to hear from you.</p>
