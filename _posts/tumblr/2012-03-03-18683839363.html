<p>The launch date for the new learning site is quickly approaching.  It has been an excellent opportunity to be able to learn so much about the <a href="http://moodle.org" title="Go to Moodle.org" target="_blank">Moodle</a> Learning Management System (LMS). The New England ADA Project is in the process of migrating the current courses to the new LMS from our own hosted sites. I am excited to announce that the project is nearly complete and should be ready in the next month.</p>
