<p>Below is the keynote presentation I gave to the City of Boulder last May at the end of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Grant project. The purpose was to research a web application and develop a simple proof of concept that allows use to show community information.</p>

<p>The City was interested in the results of the project that could be applied to a more narrow application, like a single planning project that effects the community.</p>
