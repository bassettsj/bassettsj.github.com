<h2>Done making a map using Google Fusion Tables - Boulder&#8217;s Zoning Codes</h2>

<p>Many commercial mapping services offer an easy to use interface that allows cartographers to display their GIS data, but until recently you were only able to process the data on the standard ArcGIS desktop application, or another GIS application. It is exciting to see that cloud-based databases could provide a place of agencies and communities to contribute data and build geospatial information. <br/>Here is an example of a zoning map that was created and styles within Google Fusion Tables.</p>
