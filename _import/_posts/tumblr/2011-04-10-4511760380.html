title: First Post! Wow, that is exciting!

<p>This site is going to be my personal and public site about me, projects I am working on and content that I think is important. Sounds a bit narsastic. but the URL is sjbassett. I am going to post relevent information as I continue to look for my next exciting opportunity after I graduate from CU, Boulder and look to the Bay area for where I might find my next career, return to school and continue a wonderfully developing relationship with my partner. I am not sure how this site is going to develop over the next few weeks, but <em>please keep posted.</em></p>

<p>Feel free to comment to my blog here and <strong>please follow me.</strong></p>

<p>Be well always!</p>

<p>Steven</p>
