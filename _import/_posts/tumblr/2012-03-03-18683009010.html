<p>Check out this site I helped the New England ADA Center publish. It is very simple but wrote the whole thing in a simple text editor. I can&#8217;t wait to continue to grow my web design skills. It was also my first attempt at building a site with media-queries to respond to different screen sizes and for better printing.</p>
